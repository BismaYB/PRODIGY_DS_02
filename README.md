## Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Project Description
This project involves cleaning and analyzing the Titanic dataset. The primary goal is to explore relationships between various passenger attributes and their survival rates during the disaster. This project showcases skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## Relationships Between Variables:

Age and Survived: There is a negative correlation between age and survival rate, indicating that older passengers are less likely to survive.

Fare and Survived: There is a positive correlation between fare and survival rate, indicating that passengers with higher fares are more likely to
survive.

Sex and Survived: Female passengers have a significantly higher survival rate compared to male passengers.

Pclass and Survived: Passengers in higher classes have a significantly higher survival rate compared to those in lower classes.

### Trends:

Increasing Survival Rate with Higher Fare: The survival rate increases with higher fares, indicating that passengers who paid more for their tickets were more likely to survive.
Decreasing Survival Rate with Older 
Age: The survival rate decreases with older age, indicating that older passengers were less likely to survive.
Higher Survival Rate for Female Passengers: Female passengers have a significantly higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
Higher Survival Rate for Passengers in Higher Classes: Passengers in higher classes have a significantly higher survival rate compared to 
those in lower classes
